        Nobody’s born<em> smart</em>. We all start at 0. Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra.<br>
        Adding, reading, writing, <em>riding a bike</em>. <strong>Nobody’s good at anything at first</strong>.<br>
        There was a time when <em>Einstein </em>couldn’t count to 10.<br>
        And <em>Shakespeare</em> had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.<br>
        Thankfully, <strong>we are born to learn</strong>.<br>
        Slowly. Surely. <strong>You stumble</strong>, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
        Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.<br>
        <em>Until one day, you walk</em>.<br>
        One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
        <strong>Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger</strong>.<br>
        <em>Failing</em> is just another word for <em>growing</em>. And you keep going.<br>
        This. is. learning.<br>
        It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
        You just don’t get it, yet.
        Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
        are built on basic ideas that anyone, anywhere can understand.<br>
        Whoever you are, wherever you are.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        You only have to know one thing:<br>
        <strong>You can learn anything</strong>.
